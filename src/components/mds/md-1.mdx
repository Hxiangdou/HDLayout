### Visual Text Generation Architecture
The process begins with extracting textual information from the input prompt, which is then used by the *T2I generation module* to create a background image based on a predefined diffusion model. 
This background image is passed to the *HDLayout generation module*, which progressively refines hierarchical and directional text layout information from coarse to fine, encompassing region-level, line-level, and character-level details, while adjusting the layout according to the textual input. 
Finally, the *Visual Text Render Module* combines the background image and HDLayout information to render the final visual text image, leveraging fine-tuned diffusion models to ensure high-quality output. 
Notably, both the *T2I generation module* and the *Visual Text Render Module* are designed to be flexible, allowing for seamless replacement with evolving T2I models to adapt to future advancements in the field.

### HDLayout Generation Module
The HDLayout generation module begins by extracting image features from the input background image using a backbone network. 
It then refines the hierarchical and directional text layout progressively across three levels: region-level, line-level, and character-level. 
At each level, a consistent architecture combining self-attention, cross-attention, MLPs, and linear layers is employed, with features from the previous level passed as prior knowledge to guide the next level's refinement. 
Region-level and line-level layouts are represented using rectangular bounding boxes to capture the overall text structure, while character-level details are modeled using Bezier curves to handle complex and arbitrary text shapes. 
This hierarchical approach ensures accurate representation of both large-scale text regions and fine-grained text variations, resulting in natural and realistic scene text images.
